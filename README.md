# My Portfolio
I have been working as an associate product manager and web editor. My portfolio site has the sites that I have built with html & css, Wordpress, Wix, Duda and as well as the brochure, flyer, buisess cards that were created by using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I have done more than portfolios and pretty sure that I will make more and better!
