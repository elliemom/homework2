# My Portfolio
I am very organized, responsible, detail oriented and great at communicating with others and working as part of a team. I am proficient in Illustrator, Photoshop and Microsoft office Suite. I enjoy creating an organized environment and creating ways to increase efficiency and productivity in the workplace. I will always go one step further to ensure all necessary steps are followed accurately and tasks are completed on time with as few setbacks as possible.
