**Index/About Me**
*Introduced myself
*Wanted to make with full-width for desktop display but I thought the layout should be sames as the sample images.
*So I adjusted the width to 70% for desktop display and the width for tablet and PC is 90%.
*But when I adjusted the screen size by mouse by using iMac and MacBook, it seems a little different.

**Portfolio**
*My real portfolios that I created by using wordpress, wix and duda. 
*Since I worked as a graphic designer, I thought it would be easy to create a site by using html and css.
*But it was a little harder than I thought.
*Especially the part that I needed to make as same as possible comparing to the sample images.

**Contact**
*General "contact" page and "Submit" button is actually working to send an email to my personal email.
